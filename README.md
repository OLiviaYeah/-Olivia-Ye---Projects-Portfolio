# Olivia Ye - Projects Portfolio

## Index

This repository holds all of my personal projects that I've done. Currently they're binned in three different categories:

1. SQL (https://oliviayeah.github.io/-E-Commerce-User-Behavior-Analysis/)
2. Tableau ( https://oliviayeah.github.io/Sales-Performance-Visualization-Dashboard-/)
3. Python (https://oliviayeah.github.io/Hotel-Booking-Demand-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/)

Each category has their own variety of projects and should be accompanied by some form of documentation.
